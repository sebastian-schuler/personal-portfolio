## Abstract

Using various text sources such as APIs, this project presents a single-player version of the popular typing game TypeRacer. The game was developed with React and TypeScript and was a personal project for fun. In its current state, the game is a simple prototype and does not offer any multiplayer functionality or other advanced features. However, it is fully functional and can be played in the browser.
